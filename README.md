This is a final project repo for Harvard CS207 system development course.

Implemented 3 database like systems in this project:
*Storage manager and associated SMTimeSeries;

*socket server fronted red-black tree based Vantage Point database.

All 3 of these talk to the REST HTTP server. The whole project was installed on AWS, including all the python, postgres, nginx, etc.
