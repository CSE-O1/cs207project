#CS207 Project

This is a final project repo for Harvard CS207 system development course.

Implemented 3 database like systems in this project:
  * Storage manager and associated SMTimeSeries;
  * postgres database with metadata;
  * socket server fronted red-black tree based Vantage Point database.

All 3 of these talk to the REST HTTP server. The whole project was installed on AWS, including all the python, postgres, nginx, etc.
